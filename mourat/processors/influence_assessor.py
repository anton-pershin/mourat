Per FR3/FR4 of the resolution spec: fwci (the provider's field-weighted,
age-normalised measure) is preferred; citations per year is the fallback when
fwci is absent or malformed. The chosen measure is recorded on the paper and
mapped onto 0-100 through the configured breakpoints of the same measure, so
two stored scores are comparable regardless of which measure produced them.
