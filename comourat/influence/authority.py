"""Authority influence assessment.

Maps (authors, affiliations) -> a single 0-100 authority influence score
per paper via a batched LLM call, judged against prompt-configured anchors.

Batched classification per the established pattern: each paper in the
prompt carries a stable id; verdicts are matched back by id; hallucinated
ids are silently discarded. Fail-open with score 0: this score is not a
filter anywhere on the path, so a paper never receives a score that removes
it from the pipeline.

Verdict failure handling:
- (1) transport error / (2) malformed response on the whole batch: bounded
  retry loop (same batch re-sent up to `request_retries` attempts with
  `request_retry_delay_seconds` between attempts); after exhaustion every
  paper in the batch continues with score 0 and a logged warning.
- (3) verdict missing for a paper inside a valid response: ONE follow-up
  call containing only the missing papers (same retry loop); if that also
  fails, those papers continue with score 0 and a warning.
- (4) verdict for an id not in the batch: silently discarded.
- "LLM recognises nobody": score 0, not None.
